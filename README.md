----------------------

pymozhi_gtk.py  		-- A GTK version. gtk and python are prebuilt in ubuntu. so no special softwares requires. for  using in windows you need python and gtk packages.

pyMozhi is capable of converting 'Manglish' (Phonetic English-Malayalam 
or Anglicized malayalam) into Malayalam in unicode font using 
a transliteration scheme. After downloading the above zip 
file, use Winzip/PKUNZIP to extract the three files to a directory 
of your choice. 

How to run the program
======================

You need malayalam unicode font (such as 'kartika.ttf', 'meera.ttf', etc) in your computer to use pymozhi successfully. You need to type in 
"Manglish"(phonetic English-Malayalam or anglicized malayalam) to make use of the transliteration scheme, the major strength and distinctive character of 
this program. You DO NOT NEED the complicated Kerala keyboard map for 
this program. 

On Windows
----------

If all the specified files are in the directory.
Double click pymozhi_gtk(you need python and pygtk).


On Linux
--------

Since python and gtk are avilable on Linux, you dont need any additional packages to run pymozhi_gtk.py.

	*open terminal
	*go to directory 'pymozhi'
	*type: python pymozhi_gtk.py


how to use the program
======================

A window similar to MS. Word will appear but with an 
upper and lower  division. The cursor will be in the lower section where 
your  input text goes. You type in Manglish.  The upper section of the window 
will show the text in malayalam simultaneously with your input. Click on the Scheme button to understand the Manglish transliteration scheme. if you can take keep a printed copy of Manglish for your reference. 
Once you finish typing , you may save the malayalam text to a file of 
your choice or cut/copy and paste into any word processor for further 
editing.
